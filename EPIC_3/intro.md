## General Information

The second edition of EPIC will focus on introducing computational techniques for the analysis of scientific data and images by using the programming languages python and julia as tools. The number of participants will be restricted to 20 per topic.

Instructors will present real research problems to illustrate the use of computational tools in the experimental or theoretical study of physical systems. Basic programming notions are essential to sign up for this workshop.

At the end of this workshop, participants will be able to carry out scientific data and image analysis using computational tools. This training will allow them to extract important information about the physical systems under study.


The tutorials will focus on the following areas:

 * biophysics
 * materials science
 * particle physics
 * astrophysics

In addition, the workshop will include specialised talks by experts on the following topics:

 * data science
 * artificial intelligence
 * climate models
 * georeferenced count data


**Date**: October 11 - 14, 20212

**Format**: Online (Zoom)

**Duration**: 4 days with 16 sessions as tutorials and talks.

**Time investment**: 40 hours (20 in tutorials + 20 on your own)

**Cost**: the workshop is free


## Certificate:

A digital certificate of approval will be issued to those participants who attend all the workshop sessions and successfully complete all the tutorial activities.


## Essential Prerequisites:

 *  Basic programming experience (in python, R, and/or julia).
 *  Basic knowledge of the English language.
